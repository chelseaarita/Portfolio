			<div class="casetext">Hokulani Bake Shop was founded in November 2005 by husband and wife team Tushar and Ana Dubey. There are currently four locations on Oahu.<br/><br/>

			 Hokulani finds inspiration through the culture, aloha spirit, and lifestyle while priding themselves in creating their cupcakes from scratch with using real ingredients. i.e., no margine or corn syrup. “Hokulani,” in Hawaiian, also means ‘Heavenly Star,’ which was a great starting point to my sketches.<br/><br/>

			 Aside with the star idea, I started seeking ideas with an island concept. I looked at the Bahamas' logo and played off with the island theme with leaves/petas. I also started sketching ideas flowers without being too cliché.<br/><br/>

			I needed more direction so my mentor pushed me into the flower/star concept as well as the island concept.<br/><br/>

			My mentor told me to narrow it to three concepts. Based off my feedback, I chose these sketches. I was also asked to explore type options. I went with a script type because Hawaii is old-fashioned and slow to change. I wanted something script but modern without it being over the top.<br/><br/>

			<img src="img/sketch7.png" class="u-max-full-width"><br/><br/>

			Surprisengly, my mentor was very drawn to the flower/star shape. “There is something nice about the asymmetry of the petals,” he said. Together we collaborated and came up with this idea. <br/><br/>

			I chose these colors because I felt they best represented the Hawaiian islands from the colors of the sunsets to the native fruits. In fact, these colors feel nostaglic and reminded me of my childhood days.<br/><br/>

			The logo with the colors I originally chose.

			There wasn't enough contrast in my logo so I had to go darker. At first my mentor said to play off with the dark purple and yellow-orange but it reminded me too much of certain sports teams, so he told me to explore more with color. <br/><br/>
